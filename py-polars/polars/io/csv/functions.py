    """
    Read a CSV file into a DataFrame.

    Notes
    -----
    This operation defaults to a `rechunk` operation at the end, meaning that
    all data will be stored continuously in memory.
    Set `rechunk=False` if you are benchmarking the csv-reader. A `rechunk` is
    an expensive operation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    source
        Path to a file or a file-like object.
        By file-like object, we refer to objects with a ``read()``
        method, such as a file handler (e.g. via builtin ``open``
        function) or ``StringIO`` or ``BytesIO``.
        If ``fsspec`` is installed, it will be used to open remote
        files.
    has_header
        Indicate if the first row of dataset is a header or not.
        If set to False, column names will be autogenerated in the
        following format: ``column_x``, with ``x`` being an
        enumeration over every column in the dataset starting at 1.
    columns
        Columns to select. Accepts a list of column indices (starting
        at zero) or a list of column names.
    new_columns
        Rename columns right after parsing the CSV file. If the given
        list is shorter than the width of the DataFrame the remaining
        columns will have their original name.
    separator
        Single byte character to use as delimiter in the file.
    comment_char
        Single byte character that indicates the start of a comment line,
        for instance ``#``.
    quote_char
        Single byte character used for csv quoting, default = ``"``.
        Set to None to turn off special handling and escaping of quotes.
    skip_rows
        Start reading after ``skip_rows`` lines.
    dtypes
        Overwrite dtypes for specific or all columns during schema inference.
    null_values
        Values to interpret as null values. You can provide a:

        - ``str``: All values equal to this string will be null.
        - ``List[str]``: All values equal to any string in this list will be null.
        - ``Dict[str, str]``: A dictionary that maps column name to a
          null value string.
    missing_utf8_is_empty_string
        By default a missing value is considered to be null; if you would prefer missing
        utf8 values to be treated as the empty string you can set this param True.
    ignore_errors
        Try to keep reading lines if some lines yield errors.
        Before using this option, try to increase the number of lines used for schema
        inference with e.g ``infer_schema_length=10000`` or override automatic dtype
        inference for specific columns with the ``dtypes`` option or use
        ``infer_schema_length=0`` to read all columns as ``pl.Utf8`` to check which
        values might cause an issue.
    try_parse_dates
        Try to automatically parse dates. Most ISO8601-like formats can
        be inferred, as well as a handful of others. If this does not succeed,
        the column remains of data type ``pl.Utf8``.
        If ``use_pyarrow=True``, dates will always be parsed.
    n_threads
        Number of threads to use in csv parsing.
        Defaults to the number of physical cpu's of your system.
    infer_schema_length
        Maximum number of lines to read to infer schema.
        If schema is inferred wrongly (e.g. as ``pl.Int64`` instead of ``pl.Float64``),
        try to increase the number of lines used to infer the schema or override
        inferred dtype for those columns with ``dtypes``.
        If set to 0, all columns will be read as ``pl.Utf8``.
        If set to ``None``, a full table scan will be done (slow).
    batch_size
        Number of lines to read into the buffer at once.
        Modify this to change performance.
    n_rows
        Stop reading from CSV file after reading ``n_rows``.
        During multi-threaded parsing, an upper bound of ``n_rows``
        rows cannot be guaranteed.
    encoding : {'utf8', 'utf8-lossy', ...}
        Lossy means that invalid utf8 values are replaced with ``�``
        characters. When using other encodings than ``utf8`` or
        ``utf8-lossy``, the input is first decoded in memory with
        python. Defaults to ``utf8``.
    low_memory
        Reduce memory usage at expense of performance.
    rechunk
        Make sure that all columns are contiguous in memory by
        aggregating the chunks into a single array.
    use_pyarrow
        Try to use pyarrow's native CSV parser. This will always
        parse dates, even if ``try_parse_dates=False``.
        This is not always possible. The set of arguments given to
        this function determines if it is possible to use pyarrow's
        native parser. Note that pyarrow and polars may have a
        different strategy regarding type inference.
    storage_options
        Extra options that make sense for ``fsspec.open()`` or a
        particular storage connection.
        e.g. host, port, username, password, etc.
    skip_rows_after_header
        Skip this number of rows when the header is parsed.
    row_count_name
        If not None, this will insert a row count column with the given name into
        the DataFrame.
    row_count_offset
        Offset to start the row_count column (only used if the name is set).
    sample_size
        Set the sample size. This is used to sample statistics to estimate the
        allocation needed.
    eol_char
        Single byte end of line character.

    batch_size
        Number of lines to read into the buffer at once.

        Modify this to change performance.
    n_rows
        Stop reading from CSV file after reading ``n_rows``.
        During multi-threaded parsing, an upper bound of ``n_rows``
        rows cannot be guaranteed.
    encoding : {'utf8', 'utf8-lossy', ...}
        Lossy means that invalid utf8 values are replaced with ``�``
        characters. When using other encodings than ``utf8`` or
        ``utf8-lossy``, the input is first decoded in memory with
        python. Defaults to ``utf8``.
    low_memory
        Reduce memory usage at expense of performance.
    rechunk
        Make sure that all columns are contiguous in memory by
        aggregating the chunks into a single array.
    skip_rows_after_header
        Skip this number of rows when the header is parsed.
    row_count_name
        If not None, this will insert a row count column with the given name into
        the DataFrame.
    row_count_offset
        Offset to start the row_count column (only used if the name is set).
    sample_size
        Set the sample size. This is used to sample statistics to estimate the
        allocation needed.
    eol_char
        Single byte end of line character.

    """
    Lazily read from a CSV file or multiple files via glob patterns.

    This allows the query optimizer to push down predicates and
    projections to the scan level, thereby potentially reducing
    memory overhead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    source
        Path to a file.
    has_header
        Indicate if the first row of dataset is a header or not.
        If set to False, column names will be autogenerated in the
        following format: ``column_x``, with ``x`` being an
        enumeration over every column in the dataset starting at 1.
    separator
        Single byte character to use as delimiter in the file.
    comment_char
        Single byte character that indicates the start of a comment line,
        for instance ``#``.
    quote_char
        Single byte character used for csv quoting, default = ``"``.
        Set to None to turn off special handling and escaping of quotes.
    skip_rows
        Start reading after ``skip_rows`` lines. The header will be parsed at this
        offset.
    dtypes
        Overwrite dtypes during inference; should be a {colname:dtype,} dict or,
        if providing a list of strings to ``new_columns``, a list of dtypes of
        the same length.
    null_values
        Values to interpret as null values. You can provide a:

        - ``str``: All values equal to this string will be null.
        - ``List[str]``: All values equal to any string in this list will be null.
        - ``Dict[str, str]``: A dictionary that maps column name to a
          null value string.
    missing_utf8_is_empty_string
        By default a missing value is considered to be null; if you would prefer missing
        utf8 values to be treated as the empty string you can set this param True.
    ignore_errors
        Try to keep reading lines if some lines yield errors.
        First try ``infer_schema_length=0`` to read all columns as
        ``pl.Utf8`` to check which values might cause an issue.
    cache
        Cache the result after reading.
    with_column_names
        Apply a function over the column names just in time (when they are determined);
        this function will receive (and should return) a list of column names.
    infer_schema_length
        Maximum number of lines to read to infer schema.
        If set to 0, all columns will be read as ``pl.Utf8``.
        If set to ``None``, a full table scan will be done (slow).
    n_rows
        Stop reading from CSV file after reading ``n_rows``.
    encoding : {'utf8', 'utf8-lossy'}
        Lossy means that invalid utf8 values are replaced with ``�``
        characters. Defaults to "utf8".
    low_memory
        Reduce memory usage in expense of performance.
    rechunk
        Reallocate to contiguous memory when all chunks/ files are parsed.
    skip_rows_after_header
        Skip this number of rows when the header is parsed.
    row_count_name
        If not None, this will insert a row count column with the given name into
        the DataFrame.
    row_count_offset
        Offset to start the row_count column (only used if the name is set).
    try_parse_dates
        Try to automatically parse dates. Most ISO8601-like formats
        can be inferred, as well as a handful of others. If this does not succeed,
        the column remains of data type ``pl.Utf8``.
    eol_char
        Single byte end of line character
    new_columns
        Provide an explicit list of string column names to use (for example, when
        scanning a headerless CSV file). Note that unlike ``read_csv`` it is considered
        an error to provide fewer column names than there are columns in the file.

    Returns
    -------
    LazyFrame

    See Also
    --------
    read_csv : Read a CSV file into a DataFrame.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import pathlib
    >>>
    >>> (
    ...     pl.scan_csv("my_long_file.csv")  # lazy, doesn't do a thing
    ...     .select(
    ...         ["a", "c"]
    ...     )  # select only 2 columns (other columns will not be read)
    ...     .filter(
    ...         pl.col("a") > 10
    ...     )  # the filter is pushed down the scan, so less data is read into memory
    ...     .fetch(100)  # pushed a limit of 100 rows to the scan level
    ... )  # doctest: +SKIP

    We can use ``with_column_names`` to modify the header before scanning:

    >>> df = pl.DataFrame(
    ...     {"BrEeZaH": [1, 2, 3, 4], "LaNgUaGe": ["is", "hard", "to", "read"]}
    ... )
    >>> path: pathlib.Path = dirpath / "mydf.csv"
    >>> df.write_csv(path)
    >>> pl.scan_csv(
    ...     path, with_column_names=lambda cols: [col.lower() for col in cols]
    ... ).collect()

    You can also simply replace column names (or provide them if the file has none)
    by passing a list of new column names to the ``new_columns`` parameter:

    >>> df.write_csv(path)
    >>> pl.scan_csv(
    ...     path,
    ...     new_columns=["idx", "txt"],
    ...     dtypes=[pl.UInt16, pl.Utf8],
