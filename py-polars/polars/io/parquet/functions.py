    Read into a DataFrame from a parquet file.

    Notes
    -----
    * Partitioned files:
        If you have a directory-nested (hive-style) partitioned dataset, you should
        use the :func:`scan_pyarrow_dataset` method instead.
    * When benchmarking:
        This operation defaults to a `rechunk` operation at the end, meaning that all
        data will be stored continuously in memory. Set `rechunk=False` if you are
        benchmarking the parquet-reader as `rechunk` can be an expensive operation
        that should not contribute to the timings.

    Parameters
    ----------
    source
        Path to a file, or a file-like object. If the path is a directory, files in that
        directory will all be read. If ``fsspec`` is installed, it will be used to open
        remote files.
    columns
        Columns to select. Accepts a list of column indices (starting at zero) or a list
        of column names.
    n_rows
        Stop reading from parquet file after reading ``n_rows``.
        Only valid when `use_pyarrow=False`.
    use_pyarrow
        Use pyarrow instead of the Rust native parquet reader. The pyarrow reader is
        more stable.
    memory_map
        Memory map underlying file. This will likely increase performance.
        Only used when ``use_pyarrow=True``.
    storage_options
        Extra options that make sense for ``fsspec.open()`` or a particular storage
        connection, e.g. host, port, username, password, etc.
    parallel : {'auto', 'columns', 'row_groups', 'none'}
        This determines the direction of parallelism. 'auto' will try to determine the
        optimal direction.
    row_count_name
        If not None, this will insert a row count column with give name into the
        DataFrame.
    row_count_offset
        Offset to start the row_count column (only use if the name is set).
    low_memory
        Reduce memory pressure at the expense of performance.
    pyarrow_options
        Keyword arguments for `pyarrow.parquet.read_table
        <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.parquet.read_table.html>`_.
    use_statistics
        Use statistics in the parquet to determine if pages
        can be skipped from reading.
    rechunk
        Make sure that all columns are contiguous in memory by
        aggregating the chunks into a single array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    source
        Path to a file.
    n_rows
        Stop reading from parquet file after reading ``n_rows``.
    cache
        Cache the result after reading.
    parallel : {'auto', 'columns', 'row_groups', 'none'}
        This determines the direction of parallelism. 'auto' will try to determine the
        optimal direction.
    rechunk
        In case of reading multiple files via a glob pattern rechunk the final DataFrame
        into contiguous memory chunks.
    row_count_name
        If not None, this will insert a row count column with give name into the
        DataFrame
    row_count_offset
        Offset to start the row_count column (only use if the name is set)
    storage_options
        Options that inform use how to connect to the cloud provider.
        If the cloud provider is not supported by us, the storage options
        are passed to ``fsspec.open()``.
        Currently supported providers are: {'aws', 'gcp', 'azure' }.
        See supported keys here:

        * `aws <https://docs.rs/object_store/0.7.0/object_store/aws/enum.AmazonS3ConfigKey.html>`_

        * `azure <https://docs.rs/object_store/0.7.0/object_store/azure/enum.AzureConfigKey.html>`_

        If ``storage_options`` are not provided we will try to infer them from the
        environment variables.
    low_memory
        Reduce memory pressure at the expense of performance.
    use_statistics
        Use statistics in the parquet to determine if pages
        can be skipped from reading.
    hive_partitioning
        Infer statistics and schema from hive partitioned URL and use them
        to prune reads.
    retries
        Number of retries if accessing a cloud instance fails.
