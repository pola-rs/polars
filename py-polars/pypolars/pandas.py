    Read into a DataFrame from a csv file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file
        Path to a file or a file like object.
    infer_schema_length
        Maximum number of lines to read to infer schema.
    batch_size
        Number of lines to read into the buffer at once. Modify this to change performance.
    has_headers
        If the CSV file has headers or not.
    ignore_errors
        Try to keep reading lines if some lines yield errors.
    stop_after_n_rows
        After n rows are read from the CSV stop reading. This probably not stops exactly at `n_rows` it is dependent
        on the batch size.
    skip_rows
        Start reading after `skip_rows`.
    projection
        Indexes of columns to select
    sep
        Delimiter/ value seperator
    columns
        Columns to project/ select
    rechunk
        Make sure that all columns are contiguous in memory by aggregating the chunks into a single array.
    encoding
        - "utf8"
        _ "utf8-lossy"
    one_thread
        Use a single thread for the csv parsing. Set this to False to try multi-threaded parsing.

    Returns
