"""
Run all doctest examples of the `polars` module using Python's built-in doctest module.

How to check examples: run this script, if exits with code 0, all is good. Otherwise,
the errors will be reported.

How to modify behaviour for doctests:
1. if you would like code to be run and output checked: add the output below the code
   block
2. if you would like code to be run (and thus checked whether it actually not fails),
   but output not be checked: add `# doctest: +IGNORE_RESULT` to the code block. You may
   still add example output.
3. if you would not like code to run: add `#doctest: +SKIP`. You may still add example
   output.

Notes
-----
* Doctest does not have a built-in IGNORE_RESULT directive. We have a number of tests
  where we want to ensure that the code runs, but the output may be random by design, or
  not interesting for us to check. To allow for this behaviour, a custom output checker
  has been created, see below.
* The doctests depend on the exact string representation staying the same. This may not
  be true in the future. For instance, in the past, the printout of dataframes has
  changed from rounded corners to less rounded corners. To facilitate such a change,
  whilst not immediately having to add IGNORE_RESULT directives everywhere or changing
  all outputs, set `IGNORE_RESULT_ALL=True` below. Do note that this does mean no output
  is being checked anymore.
