//! # Polars: *<small>DataFrames in Rust</small>*
//!
//! Polars is a DataFrame library for Rust. It is based on [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/)'s memory model.
//! Apache arrow provides very cache efficient columnar data structures and is becoming the defacto
//! standard for columnar data.
//!
//! ## Quickstart
//! We recommend to build your queries directly with polars-lazy. This allows you to combine
//! expression into powerful aggregations and column selections. All expressions are evaluated
//! in parallel and your queries are optimized just in time.
//!
//! ```rust no_run
//! let lf1 = LazyFrame::scan_parquet("myfile_1.parquet".into(), Default::default())?
//!     .groupby([col("ham")])
//!     .agg([
//!         // expressions can be combined into powerful aggregations
//!         col("foo")
//!             .sort_by([col("ham").rank(Default::default())], [false])
//!             .last()
//!             .alias("last_foo_ranked_by_ham"),
//!         // every expression runs in parallel
//!         col("foo").cummin(false).alias("cumulative_min_per_group"),
//!         // every expression runs in parallel
//!         col("foo").reverse().list().alias("reverse_group"),
//!     ]);
//!
//! let lf2 = LazyFrame::scan_parquet("myfile_2.parquet".into(), Default::default())?
//!     .select([col("ham"), col("spam")]);
//!
//! let df = lf1
//!     .join(lf2, [col("reverse_group")], [col("foo")], JoinType::Left)
//!     // now we finally materialize the result.
//!     .collect()?;
//! ```
//!
//! This means that Polars data structures can be shared zero copy with processes in many different
//! languages.

//!
//! ## Data Structures
//! The base data structures provided by polars are `DataFrame`, `Series`, and `ChunkedArray<T>`.
//! We will provide a short, top-down view of these data structures.
//!
//! ### DataFrame
//! A `DataFrame` is a 2 dimensional data structure that is backed by a `Series`, and it could be
//! seen as an abstraction on `Vec<Series>`. Operations that can be executed on `DataFrame`s are very
//! similar to what is done in a `SQL` like query. You can `GROUP`, `JOIN`, `PIVOT` etc.
//!
//! ### Series
//! `Series` are the type agnostic columnar data representation of Polars. They provide many
//! operations out of the box, many via the [Series struct](crate::prelude::Series) and
//! [SeriesTrait trait](crate::series::SeriesTrait). Whether or not an operation is provided
//! by a `Series` is determined by the operation. If the operation can be done without knowing the
//! underlying columnar type, this operation probably is provided by the `Series`. If not, you must
//! downcast to the typed data structure that is wrapped by the `Series`. That is the `ChunkedArray<T>`.
//!
//! ### ChunkedArray
//! `ChunkedArray<T>` are wrappers around an arrow array, that can contain multiples chunks, e.g.
//! `Vec<dyn ArrowArray>`. These are the root data structures of Polars, and implement many operations.
//! Most operations are implemented by traits defined in [chunked_array::ops](crate::chunked_array::ops),
//! or on the [ChunkedArray struct](crate::chunked_array::ChunkedArray).
//!
//! ## SIMD
//! Polars / Arrow uses packed_simd to speed up kernels with SIMD operations. SIMD is an optional
//! `feature = "simd"`, and requires a nightly compiler. If you don't need SIMD, **Polars runs on stable!**
//!
//! ## API
//! Polars supports an eager and a lazy API. The eager API directly yields results, but is overall
//! more verbose and less capable of building elegant composite queries. We recommend to use the Lazy API
//! whenever you can.
//!
//! ## Expressions
//! Polars has a powerful concept called expressions.
//! Polars expressions can be used in various contexts and are a functional mapping of
//! `Fn(Series) -> Series`, meaning that they have Series as input and Series as output.
//! By looking at this functional definition, we can see that the output of an `Expr` also can serve
//! as the input of an `Expr`.
//!
//! That may sound a bit strange, so lets give an example. The following is an expression:
//!
//! `col("foo").sort().head(2)`
//!
//! The snippet above says select column `"foo"` then sort this column and then take first 2 values
//! of the sorted output.
//! The power of expressions is that every expression produces a new expression and that they can
//! be piped together.
//! You can run an expression by passing them on one of polars execution contexts.
//! Here we run two expressions in the **select** context:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use polars::prelude::*;
//! # let df = DataFrame::default();
//!   df.lazy()
//!    .select([
//!        col("foo").sort(Default::default()).head(None),
//!        col("bar").filter(col("foo").eq(lit(1))).sum(),
//!    ])
//!    .collect()?;
//! ```
//! All expressions are ran in parallel, meaning that separate polars expressions are embarrassingly parallel.
//! (Note that within an expression there may be more parallelization going on).
//!
//! Understanding polars expressions is most important when starting with the polars library. Read more
//! about them in the [User Guide](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars-book/user-guide/dsl/intro.html).
//! Though the examples given there are in python. The expressions API is almost identical and the
//! the read should certainly be valuable to rust users as well.
//!
//! ### Eager
//! Read more in the pages of the following data structures /traits.
//!
//! * [DataFrame struct](crate::frame::DataFrame)
//! * [Series struct](crate::series::Series)
//! * [Series trait](crate::series::SeriesTrait)
//! * [ChunkedArray struct](crate::chunked_array::ChunkedArray)
//! * [ChunkedArray operations traits](crate::chunked_array::ops)
//!
//! ### Lazy
//! Unlock full potential with lazy computation. This allows query optimizations and provides Polars
//! the full query context so that the fastest algorithm can be chosen.
//!

//!
//! ## Compile times
//! A DataFrame library typically consists of
//!
//! * Tons of features
//! * A lot of datatypes
//!
//! Both of these really put strain on compile times. To keep Polars lean, we make both **opt-in**,
//! meaning that you only pay the compilation cost, if you need it.
//!
//! ## Compile times and opt-in features
//! The opt-in features are (not including dtype features):
//!
//! * `performant` - Longer compile times more fast paths.
//! * `lazy` - Lazy API
//!     - `lazy_regex` - Use regexes in [column selection](crate::lazy::dsl::col)
//!     - `dot_diagram` - Create dot diagrams from lazy logical plans.
//! * `random` - Generate arrays with randomly sampled values
//! * `ndarray`- Convert from `DataFrame` to `ndarray`
//! * `temporal` - Conversions between [Chrono](https://docs.rs/chrono/) and Polars for temporal data types
//! * `strings` - Extra string utilities for `Utf8Chunked`
//! * `object` - Support for generic ChunkedArrays called `ObjectChunked<T>` (generic over `T`).
//!              These are downcastable from Series through the [Any](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/any/index.html) trait.
//! * Performance related:
//!     - `simd` - SIMD operations _(nightly only)_
//!     - `bigidx` - Activate this feature if you expect >> 2^32 rows. This has not been needed by anyone.
//!                  This allows polars to scale up way beyond that by using `u64` as an index.
//!                  Polars will be a bit slower with this feature activated as many data structures
//!                  are less cache efficient.
//! * IO related:
//!     - `serde` - Support for [serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde) serialization and deserialization.
//!                 Can be used for JSON and more serde supported serialization formats.
//!     - `serde-lazy` - Support for [serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde) serialization and deserialization.
//!                 Can be used for JSON and more serde supported serialization formats.

//!     - `json` - JSON serialization
//!     - `ipc` - Arrow's IPC format serialization
//!     - `decompress` - Automatically infer compression of csv-files and decompress them.
//!                      Supported compressions:
//!                         * zip
//!                         * gzip
//!
//! * `DataFrame` operations:
//!     - `dynamic_groupby` - Groupby based on a time window instead of predefined keys.
//!                           Also activates rolling window group by operations.
//!     - `sort_multiple` - Allow sorting a `DataFrame` on multiple columns
//!     - `rows` - Create `DataFrame` from rows and extract rows from `DataFrames`.

//!
//! ## Compile times and opt-in data types
//! As mentioned above, Polars `Series` are wrappers around
//! `ChunkedArray<T>` without the generic parameter `T`.
//! To get rid of the generic parameter, all the possible value of `T` are compiled
//! for `Series`. This gets more expensive the more types you want for a `Series`. In order to reduce
//! the compile times, we have decided to default to a minimal set of types and make more `Series` types
//! opt-in.
//!
//! Note that if you get strange compile time errors, you probably need to opt-in for that `Series` dtype.
//! The opt-in dtypes are:
//!
//! | data type               | feature flag      |
//! |-------------------------|-------------------|
//! | Date                    | dtype-date        |
//! | Datetime                | dtype-datetime    |
//! | Time                    | dtype-time        |
//! | Duration                | dtype-duration    |
//! | Int8                    | dtype-i8          |
//! | Int16                   | dtype-i16         |
//! | UInt8                   | dtype-u8          |
//! | UInt16                  | dtype-u16         |
//! | Categorical             | dtype-categorical |
//! | Struct                  | dtype-struct      |
//!
//!
//! Or you can choose on of the preconfigured pre-sets.
//!
//! * `dtype-full` - all opt-in dtypes.
//! * `dtype-slim` - slim preset of opt-in dtypes.
//!
//! ## Performance and string data
//! Large string data can really slow down your queries.
//! Read more in the [performance section](crate::docs::performance)
//!
//! ### Custom allocator
//! A DataFrame library naturally does a lot of heap allocations. It is recommended to use a custom
//! allocator.
//! [Mimalloc](https://crates.io/crates/mimalloc) and
//! [JeMalloc](https://crates.io/crates/tikv-jemallocator) for instance, show a significant
//! performance gain in runtime as well as memory usage.
//!
//! #### Usage
//! ```ignore
//! use mimalloc::MiMalloc;
//!
//! #[global_allocator]
//! static GLOBAL: MiMalloc = MiMalloc;
//! ```
//!
//! #### Cargo.toml
//! ```ignore
//! [dependencies]
//! mimalloc = { version = "*", default-features = false }
//! ```
//! ## Config with ENV vars
//!
//! * `POLARS_FMT_NO_UTF8` -> use ascii tables in favor of utf8.
//! * `POLARS_FMT_MAX_COLS` -> maximum number of columns shown when formatting DataFrames.
//! * `POLARS_FMT_MAX_ROWS` -> maximum number of rows shown when formatting DataFrames.
//! * `POLARS_TABLE_WIDTH` -> width of the tables used during DataFrame formatting.
//! * `POLARS_MAX_THREADS` -> maximum number of threads used to initialize thread pool (on startup).
//! * `POLARS_VERBOSE` -> print logging info to stderr
//! * `POLARS_NO_PARTITION` -> Polars may choose to partition the groupby operaiton, based on data
//!                            cardinality. Setting this env var will turn partitioned groupby's off
//! * `POLARS_PARTITION_SAMPLE_FRAC` -> how large chunk of the dataset to sample to determine cardinality,
//!                                     defaults to `0.001`
//! * `POLARS_PARTITION_UNIQUE_COUNT` -> at which (estimated) key count a partitioned groupby should run.
//!                                          defaults to `1000`, any higher cardinality will run default groupby.
//! * `POLARS_FORCE_PARTITION` -> Force partitioned groupby if the keys and aggregations allow it.
//! * `POLARS_ALLOW_EXTENSION` -> allows for `[ObjectChunked<T>]` to be used in arrow, opening up possibilities like using
//!                               `T` in complex lazy expressions. However this does require `unsafe` code allow this.
//! * `POLARS_NO_PARQUET_STATISTICS` -> if set, statistics in parquet files are ignored.
//!
//!
//! ## Compile for WASM
//! To be able to pretty print a `DataFrame` in `wasm32-wasi` you need to patch the `prettytable-rs`
//! dependency. If you add this snippet to your `Cargo.toml` you can compile and pretty print when
//! compiling to `wasm32-wasi` target.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [patch.crates-io]
//! prettytable-rs = { git = "https://github.com/phsym/prettytable-rs", branch = "master"}
//! ```
