## Polars v0.12
* Lot's of bug fixes

## Polars v0.10 / v0.11

* CSV Read IO
    - Parallel csv reader
* Sample DataFrames/ Series
* Performance increase in take kernel
* Performance increase in ChunkedArray builders
* Join operation on multiple columns.
* ~3.5 x performance increase in groupby operations (measured on db-benchmark),
  due to embarrassingly parallel grouping and better branch prediction (tight loops).
