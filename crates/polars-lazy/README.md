# polars-lazy

`polars-lazy` serves as the lazy query engine for the [Polars](https://crates.io/crates/polars) DataFrame library. It allows you to perform operations on DataFrames in a lazy manner, only executing them when necessary. This can lead to significant performance improvements for large datasets.

**Important Note**: This crate is **not intended for external usage**. Please refer to the main [Polars crate](https://crates.io/crates/polars) for intended usage.
