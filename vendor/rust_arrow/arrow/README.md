# Native Rust implementation of Apache Arrow

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/apache/arrow/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/apache/arrow)

## Status

This is a native Rust implementation of Apache Arrow. Currently the project
is developed and tested against nightly Rust. The current status is:

- [x] Primitive Arrays
- [x] List Arrays
- [x] Struct Arrays
- [x] CSV Reader
- [X] CSV Writer
- [X] JSON Reader
- [ ] Parquet Reader
- [ ] Parquet Writer
- [X] Arrow IPC
- [ ] Interop tests with other implementations

## Examples

The examples folder shows how to construct some different types of Arrow
arrays, including dynamic arrays created at runtime.

Examples can be run using the `cargo run --example` command. For example:

```bash
cargo run --example builders
cargo run --example dynamic_types
cargo run --example read_csv
```

## IPC

The IPC flatbuffer code was generated by running this command from the root of the project, using flatc version 1.10.0:

```bash
./regen.sh
```

The above script will run the `flatc` compiler and perform some adjustments to the source code:

- Replace `type__` with `type_`
- Remove `org::apache::arrow::flatbuffers` namespace
- Add includes to each generated file

## SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data)

Arrow uses the [packed_simd](https://crates.io/crates/packed_simd) crate to optimize many of the implementations in the
[compute](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/rust/arrow/src/compute) module using SIMD intrinsics. 
These optimizations are enabled by the `simd` feature flag and are turned on by default, but can be disabled, for example:

```bash
cargo build --no-default-features
```

For more features, see the Features heading below.

## Features

Arrow uses the following features:

* `simd`
* `flight` which contains useful functions to convert between the Flight wire format and Arrow data
* `prettyprint` which is a utility for printing record batches

`simd` is current disabled by default, while the other features are enabled by default. Disabling `prettyprint` might be necessary in order to compile Arrow to the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` WASM target.

# Publishing to crates.io

An Arrow committer can publish this crate after an official project release has
been made to crates.io using the following instructions.

Follow [these
instructions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/publishing.html) to
create an account and login to crates.io before asking to be added as an owner
of the [arrow crate](https://crates.io/crates/arrow).

Checkout the tag for the version to be released. For example:

```bash
git checkout apache-arrow-0.11.0
```

If the Cargo.toml in this tag already contains `version = "0.11.0"` (as it
should) then the crate can be published with the following command:

```bash
cargo publish
```

If the Cargo.toml does not have the correct version then it will be necessary
to modify it manually. Since there is now a modified file locally that is not
committed to GitHub it will be necessary to use the following command.

```bash
cargo publish --allow-dirty
```
