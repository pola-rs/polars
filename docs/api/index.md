# API reference

The API reference contains detailed descriptions of all public functions and objects.
It's the best place to look if you need information on a specific function.

## Python

The Python API reference is built using Sphinx.
It's available in [our docs](https://docs.pola.rs/py-polars/html/reference/index.html).

## Rust

The Rust API reference is built using Cargo.
It's available on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/polars/latest/polars/).
