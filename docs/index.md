Polars is a highly performant DataFrame library for manipulating structured data. The core is written in Rust, but the library is also available in Python. Its key features are:

- **Fast**: Polars is written from the ground up, designed close to the machine and without external dependencies.
- **I/O**: First class support for all common data storage layers: local, cloud storage & databases.
- **Easy to use**: Write your queries the way they were intended. Polars, internally, will determine the most efficient way to execute using its query optimizer.
- **Out of Core**: Polars supports out of core data transformation with its streaming API. Allowing you to process your results without requiring all your data to be in memory at the same time
- **Parallel**: Polars fully utilises the power of your machine by dividing the workload among the available CPU cores without any additional configuration.
- **Vectorized Query Engine**: Polars uses [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/), a columnar data format, to process your queries in a vectorized manner. It uses [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data) to optimize CPU usage.

## About this guide

The `Polars` user guide is intended to live alongside the API documentation. Its purpose is to explain (new) users how to use `Polars` and to provide meaningful examples. The guide is split into two parts:

- [Getting Started](getting-started/intro.md): A 10 minute helicopter view of the library and its primary function.
- [User Guide](user-guide/index.md): A detailed explanation of how the library is setup and how to use it most effectively.

If you are looking for details on a specific level / object, it is probably best to go the API documentation: [Python](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars/py-polars/html/reference/index.html) | [Rust](https://docs.rs/polars/latest/polars/).

## Performance :rocket: :rocket:

`Polars` is very fast, and in fact is one of the best performing solutions available.
See the results in h2oai's [db-benchmark](https://duckdblabs.github.io/db-benchmark/), revived by the DuckDB project.

`Polars` [TPCH Benchmark results](https://www.pola.rs/benchmarks.html) are now available on the official website.
