# Version 1

## Breaking changes

### `Series.equals` no longer checks names by default

Previously, `Series.equals` would return `False` if the Series names didn't match.
The method now no longer checks the names by default.
The previous behavior can be retained by setting `check_names=True`.

**Example**

Before:

```pycon
>>> s1 = pl.Series("foo", [1, 2, 3])
>>> s2 = pl.Series("bar", [1, 2, 3])
>>> s1.equals(s2)
False
```

After:

```pycon
>>> s1.equals(s2)
True
>>> s1.equals(s2, check_names=True)
False
```
