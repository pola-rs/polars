# Version 0.20

## Breaking changes

### Change default `join` behavior with regard to null values

Previously, null values in the join key were considered a value like any other value.
This meant that null values in the left frame would be joined with null values in the right frame.
This is expensive and does not match default behavior in SQL.

Default behavior has now been changed to ignore null values in the join key.
The previous behavior can be retained by setting `join_nulls=True`.

**Example**

Before:

```pycon
>>> df1 = pl.DataFrame({"a": [1, 2, None], "b": [4, 4, 4]})
>>> df2 = pl.DataFrame({"a": [None, 2, 3], "c": [5, 5, 5]})
>>> df1.join(df2, on="a", how="inner")
shape: (2, 3)
┌──────┬─────┬─────┐
│ a    ┆ b   ┆ c   │
│ ---  ┆ --- ┆ --- │
│ i64  ┆ i64 ┆ i64 │
╞══════╪═════╪═════╡
│ null ┆ 4   ┆ 5   │
│ 2    ┆ 4   ┆ 5   │
└──────┴─────┴─────┘
```

After:

```pycon
>>> df1.join(df2, on="a", how="inner")
shape: (1, 3)
┌─────┬─────┬─────┐
│ a   ┆ b   ┆ c   │
│ --- ┆ --- ┆ --- │
│ i64 ┆ i64 ┆ i64 │
╞═════╪═════╪═════╡
│ 2   ┆ 4   ┆ 5   │
└─────┴─────┴─────┘
>>> df1.join(df2, on="a", how="inner", join_nulls=True)  # Keeps previous behavior
shape: (2, 3)
┌──────┬─────┬─────┐
│ a    ┆ b   ┆ c   │
│ ---  ┆ --- ┆ --- │
│ i64  ┆ i64 ┆ i64 │
╞══════╪═════╪═════╡
│ null ┆ 4   ┆ 5   │
│ 2    ┆ 4   ┆ 5   │
└──────┴─────┴─────┘
```

### Preserve left and right join keys in outer joins

Previously, the result of an outer join did not contain the join keys of the left and right frames.
Rather, it contained a coalesced version of the left key and right key.
This loses information and does not conform to SQL behavior.

The behavior has been changed to include the original join keys.
Name clashes are solved by appending `_right` to the right join key name.
The previous behavior can be retained by setting `coalesce_keys=True`.

**Example**

Before:

```pycon
>>> df1 = pl.DataFrame({"L1": ["a", "b", "c"], "L2": [1, 2, 3]})
>>> df2 = pl.DataFrame({"L1": ["a", "c", "d"], "R2": [7, 8, 9]})
>>> df1.join(df2, on="L1", how="outer")
shape: (4, 3)
┌─────┬──────┬──────┐
│ L1  ┆ L2   ┆ R2   │
│ --- ┆ ---  ┆ ---  │
│ str ┆ i64  ┆ i64  │
╞═════╪══════╪══════╡
│ a   ┆ 1    ┆ 7    │
│ c   ┆ 3    ┆ 8    │
│ d   ┆ null ┆ 9    │
│ b   ┆ 2    ┆ null │
└─────┴──────┴──────┘
```

After:

```pycon
>>> df1.join(df2, on="L1", how="outer")
shape: (4, 4)
┌──────┬──────┬──────────┬──────┐
│ L1   ┆ L2   ┆ L1_right ┆ R2   │
│ ---  ┆ ---  ┆ ---      ┆ ---  │
│ str  ┆ i64  ┆ str      ┆ i64  │
╞══════╪══════╪══════════╪══════╡
│ a    ┆ 1    ┆ a        ┆ 7    │
│ b    ┆ 2    ┆ null     ┆ null │
│ c    ┆ 3    ┆ c        ┆ 8    │
│ null ┆ null ┆ d        ┆ 9    │
└──────┴──────┴──────────┴──────┘
>>> df1.join(df2, on="a", how="inner", coalesce_keys=True)  # Keeps previous behavior
shape: (4, 3)
┌─────┬──────┬──────┐

└─────┴──────┴──────┘
```

### `count` now ignores null values

The `count` method for `Expr` and `Series` now ignores null values. Use `len` to get the count with null values included.

Note that `pl.count()` and `group_by(...).count()` are unchanged. These count the number of rows in the context, so nulls are not applicable in the same way.

This brings behavior more in line with the SQL standard, where `COUNT(col)` ignores null values but `COUNT(*)` counts rows regardless of null values.

**Example**

Before:

```pycon
>>> df = pl.DataFrame({"a": [1, 2, None]})
>>> df.select(pl.col("a").count())
shape: (1, 1)
┌─────┐
│ a   │
│ --- │
│ u32 │
╞═════╡
│ 3   │
└─────┘
```

After:

```pycon
>>> df.select(pl.col("a").count())
shape: (1, 1)
┌─────┐
│ a   │
│ --- │
│ u32 │
╞═════╡
│ 2   │
└─────┘
>>> df.select(pl.col("a").len())  # Mirrors previous behavior
shape: (1, 1)
┌─────┐
│ a   │
│ --- │
│ u32 │
╞═════╡
│ 3   │
└─────┘
```

### `NaN` values are now considered equal

Floating point `NaN` values were treated as unequal across Polars operations.
This has been corrected to better match user expectation and existing standards.

While this is considered a bug fix, it is included in this guide in order to draw attention to possible impact on user workflows that may contain
`NaN` values.

**Example**

Before:

```pycon
>>> s = pl.Series([1.0, float("nan"), float("inf")])
>>> s == s
shape: (3,)
Series: '' [bool]
[
        true
        false
        true
]
```

After:

```pycon
>>> s == s
shape: (3,)
Series: '' [bool]
[
        true
        true
        true
]
```

### Assertion utils updates to exact checking and `NaN` equality

The assertion utility functions `assert_frame_equal` and `assert_series_equal` would use the tolerance parameters `atol` and `rtol` to do approximate checking, unless `check_exact` was set to `True`.
This could lead to some surprising behavior, as integers are generally thought of as exact values.
Integer values are now always checked exactly.
To do inexact checking, convert to float first.

Additionally, the `nans_compare_equal` parameter has been removed and `NaN` values are now always considered equal, which was the previous default behavior.
This parameter had previously been deprecated but has been removed before the end of the standard deprecation period to facilitate the change to `NaN` equality.

**Example**

Before:

```pycon
>>> from polars.testing import assert_frame_equal
>>> df1 = pl.DataFrame({"id": [123456]})
>>> df2 = pl.DataFrame({"id": [123457]})
>>> assert_frame_equal(df1, df2)  # Passes
```

After:

```pycon
>>> assert_frame_equal(df1, df2)
...
AssertionError: DataFrames are different (value mismatch for column 'id')
[left]:  [123456]
[right]: [123457]
```

### Allow all `DataType` objects to be instantiated

Polars data types are subclasses of the `DataType` class.
We had a 'hack' in place that automatically converted data types instantiated without any arguments to the `class`, rather than actually instantiating it.
The idea was to allow specifying data types as `Int64` rather than `Int64()`, which is more succinct.
However, this caused some unexpected behavior when working directly with data type objects, especially as there was a discrepancy with data types like `Datetime` which _will_ be instantiated in many cases.

Going forward, instantiating a data type will always return an instance of that class. Both classes an instances are handled by Polars, so the previous short syntax is still available. Methods that return data types like `Series.dtype` and `DataFrame.schema` now always return instantiated data types objects.

You may have to update some of your data type checks if you were not already using the equality operator (`==`), as well as update some type hints.

**Example**

Before:

```pycon
>>> s = pl.Series([1, 2, 3], dtype=pl.Int8)
>>> s.dtype == pl.Int8
True
>>> s.dtype is pl.Int8
True
>>> isinstance(s.dtype, pl.Int8)
False
```

After:

```pycon
>>> s.dtype == pl.Int8
True
>>> s.dtype is pl.Int8
False
>>> isinstance(s.dtype, pl.Int8)
True
```

### Update constructors for `Decimal` and `Array` data types

The data types `Decimal` and `Array` have had their parameters switched around.
The new constructors should more closely match user expectations.

**Example**

Before:

```pycon
>>> pl.Array(2, pl.Int16)
Array(Int16, 2)
>>> pl.Decimal(5, 10)
Decimal(precision=10, scale=5)
```

After:

```pycon
>>> pl.Array(pl.Int16, 2)
Array(Int16, width=2)
>>> pl.Decimal(10, 5)
Decimal(precision=10, scale=5)
```

### `DataType.is_nested` changed from a property to a class method

This is a minor change, but a very important one to properly update.
Failure to update accordingly may result in faulty logic, as Python will evaluate the _method_ to `True`.
For example, `if dtype.is_nested` will now evaluate to `True` regardless of the data type, because it returns the method, which Python considers truthy.

**Example**

Before:

```
>>> pl.List(pl.Int8).is_nested
True
```

After:

```
>>> pl.List(pl.Int8).is_nested()
True
```

### Smaller integer data types for datetime components `dt.month`, `dt.week`

Most datetime components such as `month` and `week` would previously return a `UInt32` type.
This has been updated to the smallest appropriate signed integer type.
This should reduce memory consumption.

| Method      | Dtype old | Dtype new |
| ----------- | --------- | --------- |
| year        | i32       | i32       |
| iso_year    | i32       | i32       |
| quarter     | u32       | i8        |
| month       | u32       | i8        |
| week        | u32       | i8        |
| day         | u32       | i8        |
| weekday     | u32       | i8        |
| ordinal_day | u32       | i16       |
| hour        | u32       | i8        |
| minute      | u32       | i8        |
| second      | u32       | i8        |
| millisecond | u32       | i32*      |
| microsecond | u32       | i32       |
| nanosecond  | u32       | i32       |

_*Technically, `millisecond` can be an `i16`. This may be updated in the future._

**Example**

Before:

```pycon
>>> from datetime import date
>>> s = pl.Series([date(2023, 12, 31), date(2024, 1, 1)])
>>> s.dt.month()
shape: (2,)
Series: '' [u32]
[
        12
        1
]
```

After:

```pycon
>>> s.dt.month()
shape: (2,)
Series: '' [u8]
[
        12
        1
]
```

### `value_counts` resulting column renamed from `counts` to `count`

The resulting struct field for the `value_counts` method has been renamed from `counts` to `count`.

**Example**

Before:

```pycon
>>> s = pl.Series("a", ["x", "x", "y"])
>>> s.value_counts()
shape: (2, 2)
┌─────┬────────┐
│ a   ┆ counts │
│ --- ┆ ---    │
│ str ┆ u32    │
╞═════╪════════╡
│ x   ┆ 2      │
│ y   ┆ 1      │
└─────┴────────┘
```

After:

```pycon
>>> s.value_counts()
shape: (2, 2)
┌─────┬───────┐
│ a   ┆ count │
│ --- ┆ ---   │
│ str ┆ u32   │
╞═════╪═══════╡
│ x   ┆ 2     │
│ y   ┆ 1     │
└─────┴───────┘
```

## Deprecations

### Cumulative functions renamed from `cum*` to `cum_*`

Technically, this deprecation was introduced in version `0.19.14`, but many users will first encounter it when upgrading to `0.20`.
It's a relatively impactful change, which is why we mention it here.

| Old name    | New name     |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| `cumfold`   | `cum_fold`   |
| `cumreduce` | `cum_reduce` |
| `cumsum`    | `cum_sum`    |
| `cumprod`   | `cum_prod`   |
| `cummin`    | `cum_min`    |
| `cummax`    | `cum_max`    |
| `cumcount`  | `cum_count`  |
