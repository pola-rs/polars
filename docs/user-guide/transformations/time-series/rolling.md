# Grouping

## Grouping by fixed windows

We can calculate temporal statistics using `group_by_dynamic` to group rows into days/months/years etc.

### Annual average example

In following simple example we calculate the annual average closing price of Apple stock prices. We first load the data from CSV:

{{code_block('user-guide/transformations/time-series/rolling','df',['upsample'])}}

```python exec="on" result="text" session="user-guide/transformations/ts/rolling"
--8<-- "python/user-guide/transformations/time-series/rolling.py:setup"
--8<-- "python/user-guide/transformations/time-series/rolling.py:df"
```

!!! info

    The dates are sorted in ascending order - if they are not sorted in this way the `group_by_dynamic` output will not be correct!

To get the annual average closing price we tell `group_by_dynamic` that we want to:

- group by the `Date` column on an annual (`1y`) basis
- take the mean values of the `Close` column for each year:

{{code_block('user-guide/transformations/time-series/rolling','group_by',['group_by_dynamic'])}}

The annual average closing price is then:

```python exec="on" result="text" session="user-guide/transformations/ts/rolling"
--8<-- "python/user-guide/transformations/time-series/rolling.py:group_by"
```

### Parameters for `group_by_dynamic`

A dynamic window is defined by a:

- **every**: indicates the interval of the window
- **period**: indicates the duration of the window
- **offset**: can be used to offset the start of the windows

The value for `every` sets how often the groups start. The time period values are flexible - for example we could take:

- the average over 2 year intervals by replacing `1y` with `2y`
- the average over 18 month periods by replacing `1y` with `1y6mo`

We can also use the `period` parameter to set how long the time period for each group is. For example, if we set the `every` parameter to be `1y` and the `period` parameter to be `2y` then we would get groups at one year intervals where each groups spanned two years.

If the `period` parameter is not specified then it is set equal to the `every` parameter so that if the `every` parameter is set to be `1y` then each group spans `1y` as well.

Because _**every**_ does not have to be equal to _**period**_, we can create many groups in a very flexible way. They may overlap
or leave boundaries between them.

Let's see how the windows for some parameter combinations would look. Let's start out boring. ðŸ¥±

- every: 1 day -> `"1d"`
- period: 1 day -> `"1d"`

```text
this creates adjacent windows of the same size
|--|
   |--|
      |--|
```

- every: 1 day -> `"1d"`
- period: 2 days -> `"2d"`

```text
these windows have an overlap of 1 day
|----|
   |----|
      |----|
```

- every: 2 days -> `"2d"`
- period: 1 day -> `"1d"`

```text
this would leave gaps between the windows
data points that in these gaps will not be a member of any group
|--|
       |--|
              |--|
```

#### `truncate`

The `truncate` parameter is a Boolean variable that determines what datetime value is associated with each group in the output. In the example above the first data point is on 23rd February 1981. If `truncate = True` (the default) then the date for the first year in the annual average is 1st January 1981. However, if `truncate = False` then the date for the first year in the annual average is the date of the first data point on 23rd February 1981. Note that `truncate` only affects what's shown in the
`Date` column and does not affect the window boundaries.

### Using expressions in `group_by_dynamic`

We aren't restricted to using simple aggregations like `mean` in a group by operation - we can use the full range of expressions available in Polars.

In the snippet below we create a `date range` with every **day** (`"1d"`) in 2021 and turn this into a `DataFrame`.

Then in the `group_by_dynamic` we create dynamic windows that start every **month** (`"1mo"`) and have a window length of `1` month. The values that match these dynamic windows are then assigned to that group and can be aggregated with the powerful expression API.

Below we show an example where we use **group_by_dynamic** to compute:

- the number of days until the end of the month
- the number of days in a month

{{code_block('user-guide/transformations/time-series/rolling','group_by_dyn',['group_by_dynamic','explode','date_range'])}}

```python exec="on" result="text" session="user-guide/transformations/ts/rolling"
--8<-- "python/user-guide/transformations/time-series/rolling.py:group_by_dyn"
```

## Grouping by rolling windows

The rolling group by, `group_by_rolling`, is another entrance to the `group_by` context. But different from the `group_by_dynamic` the windows are
not fixed by a parameter `every` and `period`. In a rolling group by, the windows are not fixed at all! They are determined
by the values in the `index_column`.

So imagine having a time column with the values `{2021-01-06, 2021-01-10}` and a `period="5d"` this would create the following
windows:

```text
2021-01-01   2021-01-06
    |----------|

       2021-01-05   2021-01-10
             |----------|
```

Because the windows of a rolling group by are always determined by the values in the `DataFrame` column, the number of
groups is always equal to the original `DataFrame`.

## Combining group by operations

Rolling and dynamic group by operations can be combined with normal group by operations.

Below is an example with a dynamic group by.

{{code_block('user-guide/transformations/time-series/rolling','group_by_roll',['DataFrame'])}}

```python exec="on" result="text" session="user-guide/transformations/ts/rolling"
--8<-- "python/user-guide/transformations/time-series/rolling.py:group_by_roll"
```

{{code_block('user-guide/transformations/time-series/rolling','group_by_dyn2',['group_by_dynamic'])}}

```python exec="on" result="text" session="user-guide/transformations/ts/rolling"
--8<-- "python/user-guide/transformations/time-series/rolling.py:group_by_dyn2"
```
