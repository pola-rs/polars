# Window functions

Window functions are expressions with superpowers. They allow you to perform aggregations on groups in the
`select` context. Let's get a feel for what that means. First we create a dataset. The dataset loaded in the
snippet below contains information about pokemon:

{{code_block('user-guide/expressions/window','pokemon',['read_csv'])}}

```python exec="on" result="text" session="user-guide/window"
--8<-- "python/user-guide/expressions/window.py:pokemon"
```

## Group by aggregations in selection

Below we show how to use window functions to group over different columns and perform an aggregation on them.
Doing so allows us to use multiple group by operations in parallel, using a single query. The results of the aggregation
are projected back to the original rows. Therefore, a window function will almost always lead to a `DataFrame` with the same size as the original.

We will discuss later the cases where a window function can change the numbers of rows in a `DataFrame`.

Note how we call `.over("Type 1")` and `.over(["Type 1", "Type 2"])`. Using window functions we can aggregate over different groups in a single `select` call! Note that, in Rust, the type of the argument to `over()` must be a collection, so even when you're only using one column, you must provided it in an array.

The best part is, this won't cost you anything. The computed groups are cached and shared between different `window` expressions.

{{code_block('user-guide/expressions/window','group_by',['over'])}}

```python exec="on" result="text" session="user-guide/window"
--8<-- "python/user-guide/expressions/window.py:group_by"
```

## Operations per group

Window functions can do more than aggregation. They can also be viewed as an operation within a group. If, for instance, you
want to `sort` the values within a `group`, you can write `col("value").sort().over("group")` and voilÃ ! We sorted by group!

Let's filter out some rows to make this more clear.

{{code_block('user-guide/expressions/window','operations',['filter'])}}

```python exec="on" result="text" session="user-guide/window"
--8<-- "python/user-guide/expressions/window.py:operations"
```

Observe that the group `Water` of column `Type 1` is not contiguous. There are two rows of `Grass` in between. Also note
that each pokemon within a group are sorted by `Speed` in `ascending` order. Unfortunately, for this example we want them sorted in
`descending` speed order. Luckily with window functions this is easy to accomplish.

{{code_block('user-guide/expressions/window','sort',['over'])}}

```python exec="on" result="text" session="user-guide/window"
--8<-- "python/user-guide/expressions/window.py:sort"
```

`Polars` keeps track of each group's location and maps the expressions to the proper row locations. This will also work over different groups in a single `select`.

The power of window expressions is that you often don't need a `group_by -> explode` combination, but you can put the logic in a single expression. It also makes the API cleaner. If properly used a:

- `group_by` -> marks that groups are aggregated and we expect a `DataFrame` of size `n_groups`
- `over` -> marks that we want to compute something within a group, and doesn't modify the original size of the `DataFrame` except in specific cases

## Map the expression result to the DataFrame rows

In cases where the expression results in multiple values per group, the Window function has 3 strategies for linking the values back to the `DataFrame` rows:

- `mapping_strategy = 'group_to_rows'` -> each value is assigned back to one row. The number of values returned should match the number of rows.

- `mapping_strategy = 'join'` -> the values are imploded in a list, and the list is repeated on all rows. This can be memory intensive.

- `mapping_strategy = 'explode'` -> the values are exploded to new rows. This operation changes the number of rows.

## Window expression rules

The evaluations of window expressions are as follows (assuming we apply it to a `pl.Int32` column):

## More examples

For more exercise, below are some window functions for us to compute:

- sort all pokemon by type
- select the first `3` pokemon per type as `"Type 1"`
- sort the pokemon within a type by speed in descending order and select the first `3` as `"fastest/group"`
- sort the pokemon within a type by attack in descending order and select the first `3` as `"strongest/group"`
- sort the pokemon within a type by name and select the first `3` as `"sorted_by_alphabet"`
