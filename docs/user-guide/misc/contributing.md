# Contributing

See the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you would like to contribute to the `Polars` project.

If you're new to this we recommend starting out with contributing examples to the Python API documentation. The Python API docs are generated from the docstrings of the Python wrapper located in `polars/py-polars`.

Here is an example [commit](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/pull/3567/commits/5db9e335f3f2777dd1d6f80df765c6bca8f307b0) that adds a docstring.

If you spot any gaps in this User Guide you can submit fixes to the [`pola-rs/polars`](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars) repo.

Happy hunting!
