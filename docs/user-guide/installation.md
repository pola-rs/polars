# Installation

Polars is a library and installation is as simple as invoking the package manager of the corresponding programming language.

=== ":fontawesome-brands-python: Python"

    ``` bash
    pip install polars
    ```

=== ":fontawesome-brands-rust: Rust"

    ``` shell
    cargo add polars -F lazy

    # Or Cargo.toml
    [dependencies]
    polars = { version = "x", features = ["lazy", ...]}
    ```

## Importing

To use the library import it into your project

=== ":fontawesome-brands-python: Python"

    ``` python
    import polars as pl
    ```

=== ":fontawesome-brands-rust: Rust"

    ``` rust
    use polars::prelude::*;
    ```

## Feature Flags

By using the above command you install the core of `Polars` onto your system. However depending on your use case you might want to install the optional dependencies as well. These are made optional to minimize the footprint. The flags are different depending on the programming language. Throughout the user guide we will mention when a functionality is used that requires an additional dependency.

### Python

```text
# For example
pip install polars[numpy, fsspec]

### Rust

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
polars = { version = "0.26.1", features = ["lazy", "temporal", "describe", "json", "parquet", "dtype-datetime"] }
```

The opt-in features are:

- Additional data types:
  - `dtype-date`
  - `dtype-datetime`
  - `dtype-time`
  - `dtype-duration`
  - `dtype-i8`
  - `dtype-i16`
  - `dtype-u8`
  - `dtype-u16`
  - `dtype-categorical`
  - `dtype-struct`
- `performant` - Longer compile times more fast paths.
- `lazy` - Lazy API
  - `lazy_regex` - Use regexes in [column selection](crate::lazy::dsl::col)
  - `dot_diagram` - Create dot diagrams from lazy logical plans.
- `sql` - Pass SQL queries to polars.
- `streaming` - Be able to process datasets that are larger than RAM.
- `random` - Generate arrays with randomly sampled values
- `ndarray`- Convert from `DataFrame` to `ndarray`
- `temporal` - Conversions between [Chrono](https://docs.rs/chrono/) and Polars for temporal data types
- `timezones` - Activate timezone support.
- `strings` - Extra string utilities for `Utf8Chunked`
  - `string_justify` - `zfill`, `ljust`, `rjust`
  - `string_from_radix` - `parse_int`
- `object` - Support for generic ChunkedArrays called `ObjectChunked<T>` (generic over `T`).
  These are downcastable from Series through the [Any](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/any/index.html) trait.
- Performance related:
  - `nightly` - Several nightly only features such as SIMD and specialization.
  - `performant` - more fast paths, slower compile times.
  - `bigidx` - Activate this feature if you expect >> 2^32 rows. This has not been needed by anyone.
    This allows polars to scale up way beyond that by using `u64` as an index.
    Polars will be a bit slower with this feature activated as many data structures
    are less cache efficient.
  - `cse` - Activate common subplan elimination optimization
- IO related:
  <!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
  - `serde` - Support for [serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde) serialization and deserialization.
    Can be used for JSON and more serde supported serialization formats.
  - `serde-lazy` - Support for [serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde) serialization and deserialization.
    Can be used for JSON and more serde supported serialization formats.
  <!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->
  - `parquet` - Read Apache Parquet format
  - `json` - JSON serialization
  - `ipc` - Arrow's IPC format serialization
  - `decompress` - Automatically infer compression of csvs and decompress them.
    Supported compressions:
    - zip
    - gzip

- `DataFrame` operations:
  - `dynamic_group_by` - Group by based on a time window instead of predefined keys.
    Also activates rolling window group by operations.
  - `sort_multiple` - Allow sorting a `DataFrame` on multiple columns
  - `rows` - Create `DataFrame` from rows and extract rows from `DataFrames`.

  - `cross_join` - Create the cartesian product of two DataFrames.
  - `semi_anti_join` - SEMI and ANTI joins.
