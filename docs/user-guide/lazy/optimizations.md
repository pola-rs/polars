# Optimizations

If you use `Polars`' lazy API, `Polars` will run several optimizations on your query. Some of them are executed up front,
others are determined just in time as the materialized data comes in.

Here is a non-complete overview of optimizations done by polars, what they do and how often they run.

| Optimization               | Explanation                                                                                                  | runs                          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Predicate pushdown         | Applies filters as early as possible/ at scan level.                                                         | 1 time                        |
| Projection pushdown        | Select only the columns that are needed at the scan level.                                                   | 1 time                        |
| Slice pushdown             | Only load the required slice from the scan level. Don't materialize sliced outputs (e.g. join.head(10)).     | 1 time                        |
| Common subplan elimination | Cache subtrees/file scans that are used by multiple subtrees in the query plan.                              | 1 time                        |
| Simplify expressions       | Various optimizations, such as constant folding and replacing expensive operations with faster alternatives. | until fixed point             |
| Join ordering              | Estimates the branches of joins that should be executed first in order to reduce memory pressure.            | 1 time                        |
| Type coercion              | Coerce types such that operations succeed and run on minimal required memory.                                | until fixed point             |
| Cardinality estimation     | Estimates cardinality in order to determine optimal group by strategy.                                       | 0/n times; dependent on query |
