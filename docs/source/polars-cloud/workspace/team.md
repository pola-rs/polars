# Manage workspace members

The Team page serves as a central hub for managing who has access to the workspace. Administrators
are able to invite collaborators, monitor membership status, and manage user permissions.

## Adding your team to the workspace

### Email invitations

The primary method for adding team members is through email invitations:

1. Enter the email address of the person you wish to add in the provided input field
2. Click "Send email" to deliver an invitation directly to their inbox

Invitees will receive in invitation email that they can use to register and get added to the
workspace.

### Invitation links

The invitation link option is particularly useful for onboarding multiple team members
simultaneously or giving access when an emailaddress is not directly available.

1. Click "Generate invite link" to create a shareable URL
2. Copy and distribute this link through your preferred communication channels

Recipients can use this link to join the workspace without requiring an email invitation
