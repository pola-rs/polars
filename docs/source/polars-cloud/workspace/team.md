# Manage workspace members

The Team page serves as a central hub for managing who has access to the workspace. Administrators
are able to invite collaborators, monitor membership status, and manage user permissions.

## Adding your team to the workspace

### Email invitations

The primary method for adding team members is through email invitations:

1. Enter the email address of the person you wish to add in the provided input field
2. Click "Send email" to deliver an invitation directly to their inbox

Invitees will receive in invitation email that they can use to register and get added to the
workspace.

### Invitation links

With an invite link you can share the personal invitation link with an invitee.

1. Click "Generate invite link" to create a shareable URL
2. Copy and share the link to the invitee.

The invitee can use this link to join the workspace without requiring an email invitation.
