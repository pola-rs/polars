# Organizations

Organizations in Polars Cloud are the top-level entity and typically represent a company. They can
have members, contain multiple workspaces and are what you couple your billing to after the current
free testing phase ends.

To set up an organization you can either use [the dashboard](https://cloud.pola.rs/portal/) or the
following CLI commands:

- If you're just starting with Polars Cloud then you need to set up both an organization and
  workspace:

  ```bash
  pc setup
  ```

- Or if you only want to set up an organization:

  ```bash
  pc organization setup
  ```

For other subcommands you can execute the help command:

```bash
pc organization --help 

usage: pc organization [-h] [-v] [-t TOKEN] [-p TOKEN_PATH] {list,setup,delete,details} ...

positional arguments:
  {list,setup,delete,details}
    list                List all active organizations
    setup               Set up a workspace in AWS
    delete              Delete an organization
    details             Print the details of an organization
```
