# Getting started

Polars Cloud is a managed compute platform for your Polars queries. It allows you to effortlessly
run your local queries in your cloud environment, both in an interactive setting as well as for ETL
or batch jobs. By working in a 'Bring your own Cloud' model the data never leaves your environment.

## Installation

Install the Polars Cloud python library in your environment

```bash
$ pip install polars polars-cloud
```

Create an account and login by running the command below.

```bash
$ pc authenticate
```

## Connect your cloud

Polars Cloud currently exclusively supports AWS as a cloud provider.

Polars Cloud needs permission to manage hardware in your environment. This is done by deploying our
cloudformation template. See our [infrastructure](providers/aws/infra.md) section for more details.

To set up your Polars Cloud environment and connect your cloud run you can either

- Run `pc setup` to guide you through creation and connecting via CLI.
- Or create an organization and workspace
  [via the browser](https://cloud.pola.rs/portal/5f9c09/dbe6d9/dashboard).

## Run your queries

Now that we are done with the setup, we can start running queries. You can write Polars like you're
used and to only need to call `.remote()` on your `LazyFrame`. In the following example we create a
compute cluster and run a simple Polars query.
