# Start trial period

Your Polars Cloud free trial begins automatically the moment you connect your first workspace to
your AWS environment. No credit card required.

## What's Included During the Trial

During the 30-day free trial, you have full access to Polars Cloud to explore the platform in
detail. This includes:

- Complete feature access: Use all Polars Cloud capabilities without restrictions
- Team collaboration: Invite team members to collaborate in your workspace
- Serverless compute: Run queries remotely without infrastructure management
- Distributed engine: Scale your Polars queries beyond a single machine

## Cost Considerations During Trial

Polars Cloud is free during the trial. However, AWS may charge for the compute resources your
queries consume, depending on your AWS agreement. Monitor your AWS billing dashboard to track
resource usage during the trial.

## Checking Your Trial Status

You can find more information about your trial on your Organization dashboard under `Billing`. Here
you can find the current status and end date. You will also be prompted to set up billing here.

## Subscribe After Trial

When your 30-day trial concludes, you'll be prompted to subscribe via the AWS Marketplace. Your data
and workspace configurations remain intact, but new query execution pauses until subscription
activation. Once subscribed, all functionality immediately returns.

For more information about subscription options, see the [Payment and Billing page](billing.md).
