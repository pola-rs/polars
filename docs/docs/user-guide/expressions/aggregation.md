# Aggregation

`Polars` implements a powerful syntax defined not only in its lazy API, but also in its eager API. Let's take a look at what that means.

We can start with the simple [US congress `dataset`](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators).

#### Basic aggregations

You can easily combine different aggregations by adding multiple expressions in a
`list`. There is no upper bound on the number of aggregations you can do, and you can
make any combination you want. In the snippet below we do the following aggregations:

Per GROUP `"first_name"` we

- count the number of rows in the group:
  - short form: `pl.count("party")`
  - full form: `pl.col("party").count()`
- aggregate the gender values groups:
  - full form: `pl.col("gender")`
- get the first value of column `"last_name"` in the group:
  - short form: `pl.first("last_name")` (not available in Rust)
  - full form: `pl.col("last_name").first()`

Besides the aggregation, we immediately sort the result and limit to the top `5` so that
we have a nice summary overview.

{{code_block('user-guide/expressions/aggregation','basic',['groupby'])}}


```python exec="on" result="text" session="user-guide/expressions"
--8<-- "python/user-guide/expressions/aggregation.py:setup"
--8<-- "python/user-guide/expressions/aggregation.py:dataframe"
--8<-- "python/user-guide/expressions/aggregation.py:basic"
```

#### Conditionals

It's that easy! Let's turn it up a notch. Let's say we want to know how
many delegates of a "state" are "Pro" or "Anti" administration. We could directly query
that in the aggregation without the need of a `lambda` or grooming the `DataFrame`.

{{code_block('user-guide/expressions/aggregation','conditional',['groupby'])}}

```python exec="on" result="text" session="user-guide/expressions"
--8<-- "python/user-guide/expressions/aggregation.py:conditional"
```

Similarly, this could also be done with a nested GROUPBY, but that doesn't help show off some of these nice features. ðŸ˜‰

{{code_block('user-guide/expressions/aggregation','nested',['groupby'])}}

```python exec="on" result="text" session="user-guide/expressions"
--8<-- "python/user-guide/expressions/aggregation.py:nested"
```

#### Filtering

We can also filter the groups. Let's say we want to compute a mean per group, but we
don't want to include all values from that group, and we also don't want to filter the
rows from the `DataFrame` (because we need those rows for another aggregation).

In the example below we show how this can be done.

!!! note
     Note that we can make `Python` functions for clarity. These functions don't cost us anything. That is because we only create `Polars` expressions, we don't apply a custom function over a `Series` during runtime of the query.  Of course, you can make functions that return expressions in Rust, too.

{{code_block('user-guide/expressions/aggregation','filter',['groupby'])}}

```python exec="on" result="text" session="user-guide/expressions"
--8<-- "python/user-guide/expressions/aggregation.py:filter"
```

#### Sorting

It's common to see a `DataFrame` being sorted for the sole purpose of managing the ordering during a GROUPBY operation. Let's say that we want to get the names of the oldest and youngest politicians per state. We could SORT and GROUPBY.

{{code_block('user-guide/expressions/aggregation','sort',['groupby'])}}

```python exec="on" result="text" session="user-guide/expressions"
--8<-- "python/user-guide/expressions/aggregation.py:sort"
```

However, **if** we also want to sort the names alphabetically, this breaks. Luckily we can sort in a `groupby` context separate from the `DataFrame`.

{{code_block('user-guide/expressions/aggregation','sort2',['groupby'])}}

```python exec="on" result="text" session="user-guide/expressions"
--8<-- "python/user-guide/expressions/aggregation.py:sort2"
```

We can even sort by another column in the `groupby` context. If we want to know if the alphabetically sorted name is male or female we could add: `pl.col("gender").sort_by("first_name").first().alias("gender")`

{{code_block('user-guide/expressions/aggregation','sort3',['groupby'])}}

```python exec="on" result="text" session="user-guide/expressions"
--8<-- "python/user-guide/expressions/aggregation.py:sort3"
```

### Do not kill parallelization

!!! warning "Python Users Only"

    The following section is specific to `Python`, and doesn't apply to `Rust`. Within `Rust`, blocks and closures (lambdas) can, and will, be executed concurrently.

We have all heard that `Python` is slow, and does "not scale." Besides the overhead of
running "slow" bytecode, `Python` has to remain within the constraints of the Global
Interpreter Lock (GIL). This means that if you were to use a `lambda` or a custom `Python`
function to apply during a parallelized phase, `Polars` speed is capped running `Python`
code preventing any multiple threads from executing the function.

This all feels terribly limiting, especially because we often need those `lambda` functions in a
`.groupby()` step, for example. This approach is still supported by `Polars`, but
keeping in mind bytecode **and** the GIL costs have to be paid. It is recommended to try to solve your queries using the expression syntax before moving to `lambdas`. If you want to learn more about using `lambdas`, go to the [user defined functions section](./user-defined-functions.md). 


### Conclusion

In the examples above we've seen that we can do a lot by combining expressions. By doing so we delay the use of custom `Python` functions that slow down the queries (by the slow nature of Python AND the GIL).
